# docker-convenience-scripts

This repository will contain different convenience scripts for docker I have gathered over time.

## docker_clone_volume.sh

The purpose for this script is that I can easily create a clone of an existing docker data with
a new name. This will allow me to create a duplicate of an existing data volume I use in the
production environment of my blog for example and take that duplicate to my development version 
to ensure I have the latest production data also at development
